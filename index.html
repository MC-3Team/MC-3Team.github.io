    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Flippy Math! We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users, especially children. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use Flippy Math.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Microphone Access:</strong> Flippy Math requests access to your device's microphone to enable voice input features. This allows children to answer math problems using their voice.</p>
    <p><strong>Speech Recognition:</strong> We use speech recognition technology to convert the child's spoken answers into text. This feature requires an internet connection to function properly and is essential for the interactive learning experience.</p>
    <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> We use local storage on your device to save user progress within the game. This data is stored securely on your device and is not shared with any third parties.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p><strong>Voice Input and Processing:</strong> The audio captured by the microphone is processed locally on the device to recognize speech and convert it into text. This data is used solely for providing feedback and advancing the game.</p>
    <p><strong>User Progress:</strong> User progress is stored locally on your device to allow for a seamless gaming experience. This data is not transmitted over the internet or shared with others.</p>
    <p><strong>Improving User Experience:</strong> Any collected data is used to enhance the user experience, ensuring that the app functions smoothly and efficiently.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We prioritize the security of your data. All voice data is processed locally on the device and is not stored, transmitted, or shared with any third parties. User progress is securely stored on your device, and we do not have access to it.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Flippy Math is designed for children, and we take the protection of children's privacy seriously. We comply with all applicable child privacy laws and regulations.</p>

    <h2>6. Internet Connectivity</h2>
